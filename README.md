LED Cube
========

This contains code for an arduino for controlling an LED cube.

The attempt of the code is to be able to control an LED cube of any size, realisitically up to 8x8x8.
Eventually, I hope to allow the animations to be able to be controlled by a computer and displayed on the cube, but for now everything is on the cube.

I have currently created the following animations:
