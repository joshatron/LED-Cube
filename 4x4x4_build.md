4x4x4 LED Cube Build
====================

Before attempting a full 8x8x8 cube, I started by creating a 4x4x4 one.

Supplies
--------

Materials:

 * 64 LEDs (I chose blue, diffuse is better)
 * 3 ft solid core wire (I had some 22 guage lying around)
 * 15 ft small guage wire (rough approximation, for routing on protoboard)
 * 16 resistors (For mine, I used 200 ohms)
 * 1 large protoboard (Should be at least 4 inches in the smaller dimension)
 * 1 arduino (I used a mega 2560, but an uno should work too)
 * 1 small protoboard (Optional, used to make easy connection to arduino)
 * 20 pin headers (Optional, used to make easy connection to arduino)

Tools:

 * Soldering iron (Ideally a nicer one since you will be doing a lot of soldering)
 * Solder (You will need a pretty good amount of this)
 * Helping hands (Very useful to hold things in place)
 * Soldering fan (Safety first)
 * Solder sucker (Or whatever tool you prefer to unsolder mistakes)
 * Breadboard (Mainly used for testing LEDs)
